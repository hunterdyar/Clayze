# Clayze
This is the 'Clayze' package. Clayze was developed for experimental student design research by [Hunter Dyar](htttp://hdyar.com). 

# Setup
## Prerequisites
Git must be installed on the system in order for the packages to install and update. I recommend you install Git with Winget on [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), and with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

## Unity Project
- Clayze is developed with Unity 2022.3, and should work with this 2022 or newer.
- URP (Universal Render Pipelinne) is recommended, but not required.

1. Select 'Window > Package Manager'
2. Click on the plus icon, and choose 'Add Package from git URL...'.
3. Enter `https://github.com/hunterdyar/Clayze.git`
